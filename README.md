Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is like building apps or programs by following a plan, just like building a house. It’s important because it helps make sure the technology we use works well, is reliable, and keeps improving.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
2. Big moments in software engineering history:
i.1968 NATO Conference: This is when people first called it "software engineering."
ii. Agile Manifesto (2001): Developers started working together better and being more flexible.
iii. DevOps (2010s): Developers and operations teams started working closely to make things faster.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
i. Planning: Deciding what you want to build.Analysis: Figuring out what’s needed.Design: Drawing the blueprint for the software.
ii. Implementation: Writing the code.Testing: Making sure it works properly.
iii. Deployment: Putting it out there for people to use.
iv. Maintenance: Fixing any bugs or adding new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: You do one thing at a time and can’t go back easily. Great for projects with clear steps (like building a bridge).
Agile: You do a little at a time and can change things quickly. Best for projects that might need changes along the way (like developing a new app).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i. Software Developer: Writes the code to make the software work.
ii. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests the software to catch bugs.
iii. Project Manager: Makes sure everyone is doing their part on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i. IDEs (like Visual Studio): They help developers write and test code faster and easier.
ii. VCS (like Git): They keep track of code changes and make sure teams don’t mess up each other’s work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i. Changing requirements: Use flexible planning, like Agile.
ii. Technical debt (messy code): Clean up the code regularly.
iii. Time management: Break tasks into smaller pieces and track your time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i. Unit testing: Checks small pieces of the code.
ii. Integration testing: Makes sure different parts work together.
iii. System testing: Tests the whole thing.
iv. Acceptance testing: Makes sure the users will like it.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is like giving clear instructions to an AI, so it understands exactly what you want. It’s important because the better you ask, the better the AI can help you.
Example of a vague prompt:
i. Vague Prompt: "Tell me about monkeys."
ii. Improved Prompt: "What are the main differences between golden retrievers and bulldogs?"

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Why the improved prompt is better: The improved prompt is specific and clear, so the AI knows exactly what information you want about the two dog breeds, making the answer more useful
